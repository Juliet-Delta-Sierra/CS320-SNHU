How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure? 
The best way to keep code, programs and software functional is through multiple avenues, namely: 1) test it directly through dynamic methods, and 2) ensure there are no theory or logic errors through static testing. Both of these methods will ensure that the customer requirements are met and that the program demonstrates that it can meet the necessary requirements. It is not enough to assume that the main functionality of the program is enough to pass as a fully functional program. The edge cases must be tested to ensure "extremes" of the program are managed correctly.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
User needs should be stated in the format, "The [responsible party] wants to [action] so that [result/outcome]." This will translate directly into SLDC user stories and then can be tracked through a customer requirements tracibility matrix to ensure each user statement has a direct control/test method.

How do I approach designing software?
Software design should be established with a crossfunctional group and should be benchmarked with best industry practices. This should be the framework used to guide all practices for the project.
